# Deye MQTT HA Plugin

## Introduction

This plugin enables Home Assistant to automatically discover all values published by the "Deye Solar Inverter
MQTT Bridge".

Energy usage diagram provided by Home Assistant filled with data from a "Deye solar inverter MQTT bridge":

This integration can read and update the active power regulation feature's value if it's enabled. However, reading and
updating the "time of use" (ToU) configuration has not been implemented yet.

## Installation

1. Install Deye solar inverter MQTT bridge

2. Extend the Deye solar inverter MQTT bridge configuration file `config.env` as described in this example:

    ```bash
    # Home Assistant Integration
    # ==========================
    PLUGINS_ENABLED=deye_plugin_ha_discovery
    DEYE_HA_PLUGIN_HA_MQTT_PREFIX=homeassistant
    DEYE_HA_PLUGIN_INVERTER_MANUFACTURER=<your manufacturer>
    DEYE_HA_PLUGIN_INVERTER_MODEL=<your inverter>
    # Topics not published to HA
    # Use : as separator, supports Unix shell-style wildcards *, ?, [seq] and
    # [!seq] as implemented with Python fnmatch,
    DEYE_HA_PLUGIN_IGNORE_TOPIC_PATTERNS=settings/active_power_regulation:uptime:*/pv[234]/*
    ```

3. Install the plugin from `plugins` directory as described in ["How to start the docker container with custom plugins"](https://github.com/kbialek/deye-inverter-mqtt#how-to-start-the-docker-container-with-custom-plugins)

4. Switch to the Home Assistant and install [Utility Meter](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/utility_meter/)

5. Configure a Utility Meter helper to reset the daily production counter at midnight.

    ```bash
    # Example configuration.yaml entry
    utility_meter:
      energy:
        name: "Production total (daily reset)"
        source: sensor.deye_inverter_mqtt_production_total
        cycle: daily
    ```

    or graphically

## Requirements

* [Deye solar inverter MQTT bridge](https://github.com/kbialek/deye-inverter-mqtt) 2024.07.1

## Troubleshooting

1. Check log of the deye-mqtt container for errors.

    ```bash
    docker logs deye-mqtt
    ```

   On demand increase the detail of the logging in `config.env` to `LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG` and restart the container.

2. Checking the content published in the MQTT broker. You can use a graphical tool such as the [MQTT Explorer](https://mqtt-explorer.com/) for this.
